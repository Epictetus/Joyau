Joyau is a Ruby interpreter for the PSP. It runs a file called "script.rb".
It is oriented for game creation; you can easily create sprites and maps through
its built-in classes.

Notice some features:
- If an exception is not caught, Joyau will show you a debugging screen.
- Joyau adds some directories to the load path, where you can put Ruby's stdlib,
  or Joyau which has a Ruby part too.

Joyau can be compiled with rake. Use rake --task to see what is possible. 
Bassicaly:
- By default, Joyau's EBOOT is built.
- rdoc and rdoc_site : Will build Joyau's documentation.
- debug : Will build the PRX, which can be used for debugging purpose.
- release : Will create a release package from this directory.
