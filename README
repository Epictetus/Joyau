Joyau is a Ruby interpreter for the PSP, which I wrote because I've always
prefered Ruby to Lua, Python, or C++. It has a great amount of features, and 
is probably powerful enough to write the homebrews that are often released.

It notably supports the following features:
- text drawing through intrafont
- image manipulation (buffers, sprites)
- MP3 and WAV playback
- Basic drawing (circles, rects, lines)
- Sockets

Check the documentation for more informations.

To run your program, write your code in a script.rb file. You'll obviously need
Joyau's EBOOT, and might want to use the ruby directory.
